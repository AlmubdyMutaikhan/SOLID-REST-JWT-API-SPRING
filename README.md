# Project description
```
Implementation of bank app enabled with JDBC usage, REST API handling and CLI program powered by SOLID principles.
```

# Project requirements
1. IDE: IntelijIdea IDE.
2. Framework: Spring Framework and Spring Boot
3. Declaration of Beans: via @Annotations

# Run
Before you even create a build.gradle file for the project, you can ask it what tasks are available:
```
gradle tasks
```
Ensure you have build.gradle file, then build the project type the command below on terminal
```
gradle build
```
## Build the project with gradle-wrapper
The Gradle Wrapper is the preferred way of starting a Gradle build. It consists of a batch script for Windows and a shell script for OS X and Linux.
These scripts allow you to run a Gradle build without requiring that Gradle be installed on your system. 
This used to be something added to your build file, 
but itâ€™s been folded into Gradle, so there is no longer any need. Instead, you simply use the following command.
```
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 6.0.1
```
## After building
Run the DemoApplication.java class as it contains main() method.
Spring boot application should start with some output logs.
Go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html# to learn the REST API.

## Remarks
1. Added new classes(TransactionBasicCLI, TransactionListingServiceImpl) and an interface(TransactionListingService) that shows Transaction log list on command - 5.
2. Logging is followed after each operation.
3. Lombok persists.
4. Dependencies are set via @Autowired.
5. SOLID principles are enabled.
6. Server is running on port 3000.
7. Go to swagger via http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#
8. REST API
